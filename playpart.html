        <p> <h6 class="MISSTESMAN">MISS TESMAN.</h6> <p class="direction"> [Stops close to the door, listens, and says softly:] </p> <p class="speech"> Upon my word, I
            don't believe they are stirring yet! </p></p> <br>
            
           <h6 class="BERTA">BERTA.</h6> <p class="direction">[Also softly.]</p><p class="speech"> I told you so, Miss. Remember how late the steamboat got
            in last night. And then, when they got home!--good Lord, what a lot the
            young mistress had to unpack before she could get to bed.</p><br>

            <h6 class="MISSTESMAN">MISS TESMAN.</h6> <p class="speech">Well well--let them have their sleep out. But let us see that they get a
            good breath of the fresh morning air when they do appear.</p> <p class="direction">[She goes to the glass door and 
            throws it open.]</p><br>
            
            <h6 class="BERTA">BERTA.</h6> <p class="direction"> [Beside the table, at a loss what to do with the bouquet in her hand.]</p>
            <p class="speech">I declare there isn't a bit of room left. I think I'll put it down here,
            Miss.</p><br><br>

            <h6 class="MISSTESMAN">MISS TESMAN.</h6> <p class="speech">So you've got a new mistress now, my dear Berta. Heaven knows it was a
            wrench to me to part with you.</p><br>

            <h6 class="BERTA">BERTA.</h6> <p class="direction">[On the point of weeping.]</p> <p class="speech">And do you think it wasn't hard for me, too,
            Miss? After all the blessed years I've been with you and Miss Rina.(1)</p><br>

            <h6 class="MISSTESMAN">MISS TESMAN.</h6> <p class="speech">We must make the best of it, Berta. There was nothing else to be done.
            George can't do without you, you see-he absolutely can't. He has had you
            to look after him ever since he was a little boy.</p>
