        <p> MISS TESMAN. [Stops close to the door, listens, and says softly:] Upon my word, I
            don't believe they are stirring yet! <br><br>
            
            BERTA. [Also softly.] I told you so, Miss. Remember how late the steamboat got
            in last night. And then, when they got home!--good Lord, what a lot the
            young mistress had to unpack before she could get to bed.<br><br>

            MISS TESMAN. Well well--let them have their sleep out. But let us see that they get a
            good breath of the fresh morning air when they do appear.[She goes to the glass door and 
            throws it open.<br><br>
            
            BERTA. [Beside the table, at a loss what to do with the bouquet in her hand.]
            I declare there isn't a bit of room left. I think I'll put it down here,
            Miss. [She places it on the piano.<br><br>

            MISS TESMAN. So you've got a new mistress now, my dear Berta. Heaven knows it was a
            wrench to me to part with you.<br><br>

            BERTA. [On the point of weeping.] And do you think it wasn't hard for me, too,
            Miss? After all the blessed years I've been with you and Miss Rina.(1)<br><br>

            MISS TESMAN. We must make the best of it, Berta. There was nothing else to be done.
            George can't do without you, you see-he absolutely can't. He has had you
            to look after him ever since he was a little boy.
